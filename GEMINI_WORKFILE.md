- Which agents/modules exist, and in what linear order are they executed?
- How does data flow from one agent to the next?
- What is the role of the orchestrator, if any, in the pipeline?

- What are the system requirements (RAM, VRAM, storage)?
- Are there configuration files or CLI parameters that affect execution?
- What are the primary input and output formats?

# Chapter 2: Agent-by-Agent Breakdown
- What is the agent’s purpose and where does it sit in the pipeline?
- What are its input and output types and formats?
- How is it triggered? Is it called via subprocess, internal function, or API?
- What are the critical functions and classes inside this agent?
- How does it handle failures or timeouts?
- Are any ML models or heuristics used inside this agent? If so, describe them.
- What configuration parameters does it use or expose?
- Does the agent log its operations, and if so, how and where?
- Are any intermediate results stored or cached?
- Does this agent introduce significant runtime latency? Why?

# Chapter 3: AI/ML Model Usage
- Which agents use LLMs or other AI models?
- What models are used (name, size, provider, e.g., GPT-4, Whisper, etc.)?
- What is the prompt format and logic used for interacting with these models?
- How are the models hosted (local, API, GPU server)?
- Is there prompt engineering or chaining involved?
- What measures are in place to retry or validate model output?
- How are embeddings, transcripts, or other representations used?
- Are there differences in model usage between dev/test/prod?
- How is inference performance optimized (batching, context window trimming)?
- Are there rate limits, and how are they handled?

# Chapter 4: Data Flow and File Management
- What types of data flow through the pipeline (video, audio, text)?
- How are files stored, moved, or transformed across agents?
- Are files written to disk, streamed in memory, or both?
- What is the naming and directory convention for intermediate and final outputs?
- Are temporary files cleaned up?
- Is any metadata embedded in filenames or separate sidecar files?
- How are large video files handled efficiently?
- Are video segments ever recombined? If so, by what logic?
- How are concurrency or race conditions in file I/O avoided?
- What compression or encoding formats are supported?

# Chapter 5: Logging, Debugging, and Monitoring
- How is logging implemented across agents?
- What log levels are used (debug, info, error)?
- Are logs centralized or isolated per module?
- Is there a standard format or schema for logs?
- How are exceptions handled and reported?
- Is there a debug mode with extra verbosity?
- Are logs timestamped and include contextual information?
- Is there performance monitoring (execution time, memory usage)?
- Are logs persisted to file or just printed to stdout?
- Are logs used to trigger retries or alerts?

# Chapter 6: Testing and Validation
- What tests exist (unit, integration, E2E)?
- Which parts of the pipeline are covered by tests?
- Are test inputs synthetic, real, or both?
- Are outputs from each agent validated for schema, quality, or content?
- How is regression testing handled when agents are updated?
- Are test environments isolated from production (sandbox)?
- Is mocking used for external services or models?
- Are there assertions or sanity checks inside agents?
- Are test results logged or visualized?
- How are video/audio rendering correctness tested?

# Chapter 7: Pipeline Orchestration & Control
- Is there a controller or orchestrator module? If yes, describe its logic.
- How does the pipeline start and terminate?
- Are there pause/resume, step-by-step, or dry-run modes?
- How is pipeline progress tracked (e.g., % complete, per-agent status)?
- Is the pipeline synchronous or does it use a task queue?
- Can it run in parallel or only sequentially?
- What happens if one agent fails—does it retry, skip, or halt?
- Is there a CLI or GUI for running the pipeline?
- Are previous runs cached to avoid recomputation?
- Is agent execution time monitored and logged?

# Chapter 8: Configuration and Customization
- Where is the configuration located (e.g., YAML, JSON, Python file)?
- What can be customized without changing code (e.g., clip length, model name)?
- Are runtime flags or CLI options supported?
- Can modules be disabled or reordered?
- How are new agents added to the pipeline?
- Are there environment-specific configs (dev, prod)?
- How are secrets or credentials managed (API keys, tokens)?
- Are user preferences supported (e.g., language, resolution)?
- Can different presets or profiles be defined?
- How are updates to config hot-reloaded (if at all)?

# Chapter 9: Security and Privacy
- Does the pipeline handle private or sensitive data?
- Are files or logs anonymized or encrypted?
- Is access to API keys and models secured?
- Are temporary files and model outputs purged securely?
- Are models or agents allowed to connect externally?
- Are credentials stored securely (e.g., .env, secrets manager)?
- Are there user permissions or access controls?
- Is internet access sandboxed for local LLMs?
- Are third-party dependencies vetted or sandboxed?
- Is there a documented threat model?

# Chapter 10: Deployment and Runtime Environment
- What is the preferred environment (Docker, bare metal, cloud)?
- Are setup scripts or containers provided?
- Are there different environments for development and production?
- What OS and Python version is the pipeline designed for?

- Is GPU usage optimized (VRAM load, CUDA, batching)?
- What are the known performance bottlenecks?
- Are crash recovery and checkpointing implemented?
- How is the pipeline deployed and triggered (manually, cron, webhook)?
