# Future Implementations and Placeholders

## 1. Core Functionality & Features

- **Advanced Agent System:** Develop a modular agent framework to handle complex tasks:
  - Create an `Agent` base class in `core/agent_base.py` with methods like `analyze()` and `execute()`. This class should define a common interface (e.g., `analyze(self, data)` and `act(self, context)`).
  - Implement an `AgentManager` in `core/agent_manager.py` that initializes, schedules, and executes multiple agents in sequence. The manager should call each agent's methods on the relevant data at each stage of processing.
  - Define specific agents by subclassing `Agent`:
    - **StoryboardingAgent:** In `core/agents/storyboarding_agent.py`, create this class to analyze video frames and generate a storyboard. Implement methods like `analyze_frames(self, frames)` and `generate_storyboard(self)` that use visual and audio cues to outline a narrative.
    - **ContentAlignmentAgent:** In `core/agents/content_alignment_agent.py`, create this class to synchronize audio and video elements. Implement methods like `find_key_segments(self, video, transcript)` to align dialogue with scenes.
  - Integrate the agent system into the main workflow (`app.py` or main script): instantiate `AgentManager` and register all agents. Ensure that at each processing step, the manager runs the appropriate agents (e.g., call `agent.analyze()` on video frames or transcripts, and `agent.act()` to modify or select content).

## 2. LLM Usage

- **Integrate Multi-modal LLMs:** Add support for image-text and audio-text models:
  - Create a module `core/llm_models.py` (or extend an existing LLM interface) to wrap calls to multi-modal models like MiniCPM and ImageBind. This should include functions like `query_minicpm(text, image)` or `query_imagebind(audio, image)`.
  - Install and configure any necessary libraries (e.g., HuggingFace transformers, `openai-clip`, or `ollama`) to run these models locally or via API.
  - Write integration tests or demos to ensure these models can be called with sample inputs (e.g., test that ImageBind embeddings can be generated from frames).
- **Structured LLM Configuration:** Implement a robust configuration system for LLM endpoints:
  - In `core/config.yaml`, add sections for LLM settings, for example:
    ```
    llm:
      min_model: "MiniCPM"
      image_model: "ImageBind"
      api_keys:
        openai: "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"
        ollama: "http://localhost:11434"
    ```
  - Update the config loading code (`core/config.py` or similar) to parse these LLM settings into a `config` object.
  - In the code that invokes LLMs, refer to `config.llm` to select the appropriate model and API URL/key.
- **Specialized LLM Agents:** Implement dedicated agents for different LLM-driven tasks:
  - **AudioTranscriptionAgent:** Create `core/agents/audio_transcription_agent.py` with class `AudioTranscriptionAgent(Agent)`. This agent should:
    - Use an ASR model (e.g., OpenAI Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text) to transcribe the audio (`transcribe(self, audio_path)`).
    - Use an LLM (via Ollama or OpenAI) to analyze the transcription. Implement `analyze_transcript(self, transcript)` that prompts the LLM to identify themes, sentiment, and speaker changes.
    - Parse the LLM output and attach metadata (like `sentiment`, `speaker_labels`) to the transcript data.
  - **LLMSelectionAgent:** Create `core/agents/selection_agent.py` with class `LLMSelectionAgent(Agent)`. This agent should:
    - Take the video transcript and user preferences as input (`select_segments(self, transcript, preferences)`).
    - Prompt an LLM to score or suggest the most engaging segments (based on user preferences). For example, send a request to the model with the transcript and style guidelines.
    - Return a list of selected clips or time ranges. Implement logic to call LLM (using `ollama.run` or OpenAI API) and parse its output into timestamps.
  - **VideoAnalysisAgent:** Create `core/agents/video_analysis_agent.py` with class `VideoAnalysisAgent(Agent)`. This agent should:
    - Analyze video frames for scene changes, objects, and faces. Use vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV, YOLO) to detect objects/faces.
    - Optionally use an LLM to interpret visual information (e.g., prompt: "Analyze these scenes for action and context").
    - Provide methods like `extract_visual_features(self, video)` and store results (scene boundaries, object lists).
  - **VideoEditingAgent:** Create `core/agents/video_editing_agent.py` with class `VideoEditingAgent(Agent)`. This agent should:
    - Take the selected clips and analysis data as input (`edit_video(self, clips, analysis_data)`).
    - Apply editing rules: implement functions for rhythm-synced cuts (`sync_with_beats(self, clips, beats)`), transitions, and overlays.
    - Interface with video editing tools (e.g., FFmpeg, MoviePy) to produce the final edited video.
  - **ResultsSummaryAgent:** Create `core/agents/results_summary_agent.py` with class `ResultsSummaryAgent(Agent)`. This agent should:
    - Collect metadata and decisions from the pipeline (`summarize(self, processed_data)`).
    - Use an LLM to generate a textual summary of the process. For example, provide the LLM with what each agent did and ask for a report.
    - Implement a method `generate_report(self)` that returns a summary, suggested titles/descriptions, and metrics for clip engagement.

## 3. Audio Processing

- **Voice Separation:** Isolate speech from background:
  - In `audio/audio_processing.py`, implement a function `separate_vocals(audio_path)` that uses a model (e.g., Demucs or Spleeter) to separate vocals from music.
  - Ensure this function loads an audio file, processes it to extract the voice track, and outputs a clean vocal audio file.
  - Integrate this step into the transcription pipeline so that the ASR receives the cleaned audio.
- **Voice Cloning/Generation:** Support custom voices:
  - Investigate voice cloning libraries (e.g., Coqui TTS, Resemblyzer with a TTS model) to allow generating speech in different voices or accents.
  - Create `audio/voice_cloning.py` with a function `clone_voice(input_audio, text, voice_profile)` that can alter the speaker's voice or synthesize narration from text.
  - Optionally, add TTS functionality to generate spoken narration from text prompts.

## 4. Video Processing & Editing

- **Dynamic Editing & Rhythm Sync:**
  - In `video/video_editing.py`, add beat detection:
    - Use an audio analysis library (e.g., `librosa`) to implement `detect_beats(audio_path)`. Return an array of beat timestamps.
    - Create a function `sync_cuts_with_beats(clips, beats)` that trims or adjusts clips so that transitions align on music beats or speech accents.
  - Update the editing pipeline to detect beats in the audio track and use this information when timing cuts or transitions.
- **Improved Visual Retrieval & Tracking:**
  - Integrate a strong embedding model:
    - In `video/face_tracking.py`, use a model like ImageBind or a modern face-embedding network to extract face features.
    - In `video/object_tracking.py`, use the embedding model or a pretrained detector (e.g., YOLOv5) to track objects across frames.
  - Character face database:
    - Create a storage (e.g., `video/face_db.json` or a directory) to save labeled face embeddings.
    - In face tracking, when a new face is detected, compute its embedding and compare to entries in `face_db` to identify the character. If unknown, add it with a new label.
    - Provide functions `save_face_embedding(name, embedding)` and `load_face_db()` in `video/face_tracking.py`.
- **Advanced Visual Effects (VFX):**
  - In `video/video_effects.py`, implement overlay and animation helpers:
    - `add_text_overlay(clip, text, position, font, size, color)`: draw styled text on a video clip.
    - `fade_transition(clip1, clip2, duration)`: create a fade-in/fade-out transition between clips.
    - `zoom_effect(clip, scale_factor, duration)`: apply a zoom animation to a clip.
  - Use libraries like `moviepy` or `opencv` for these effects. Ensure these functions can be chained together for final video assembly.

## 5. Personalization & User Input

- **Enhanced Detailed Prompting:** Support richer user preferences:
  - Expand the CLI or UI to accept structured prompts. For example, add options for `--theme`, `--characters`, `--style`, etc.
  - Implement parsing logic: in `core/prompt_parser.py`, define functions to extract these fields from free-form text or a config.
  - If needed, use an LLM to interpret a natural-language prompt into structured parameters (e.g., prompt the model to identify theme and style from a description).
- **Configurable Personalization Options:** Make themes and layouts configurable:
  - Update `core/config.yaml` with fields like:
    ```
    personalization:
      themes: ["sports", "vlog", "news"]
      layout: "vertical"  # or "horizontal"
      style: "dramatic"   # or other style descriptors
    ```
  - Load these into the `config` object in code and apply them:
    - Filter or prioritize clips based on `config.personalization.themes`.
    - If `layout` is "vertical", set output resolution to a tall aspect ratio (e.g., 1080x1920) in the export function.
    - Adjust editing style (cuts, effects) based on `config.personalization.style`.
  - Document these options in the README or CLI help, and allow users to override them via command-line arguments.

## 6. Project Structure & Dependencies

- **Modular **``** Directory:** Organize external utilities:
  - Create a `tools/` directory at the project root to hold scripts for downloading models and external assets.
  - For example, add `tools/download_models.py` to fetch pretrained weights (LLM checkpoints, YOLO weights, Whisper models, etc.).
  - Move any stand-alone tools or notebooks (e.g., for dataset preprocessing) into this directory for clarity.
- **Migrate to **``**:** Modernize the project setup:
  - Add a `pyproject.toml` with project metadata (name, version, author) and dependencies (e.g., `ollama`, `opencv-python`, `librosa`, `torch`, etc.).
  - Consider using Poetry or PDM: lock the dependencies in `poetry.lock` or similar.
  - Update or retain `requirements.txt` for compatibility; ensure consistency between `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`.
- **Robust Dependency Management:** Document and automate installation:
  - In the README or `docs/`, list all dependencies and models. Provide instructions like `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `poetry install`.
  - In `tools/download_models.py`, script the download of required model files (e.g., Whisper model, YOLO weights, Ollama models).
  - Add environment checks (e.g., Python version, GPU availability) or a `setup.py` to guide setup. Provide troubleshooting tips for common installation issues.
