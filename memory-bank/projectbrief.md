# Project Brief: 60-Second Clips Generator

This project, "Ollama-Clip-Anything," is an automated video processing pipeline designed to generate short, engaging, and viral-worthy video clips from longer source videos. It leverages a sophisticated multi-stage architecture, integrating various AI models and agents for comprehensive audio-visual analysis, intelligent content selection, and dynamic video production.

## Core Requirements and Goals:
- **Automated Clip Generation:** Automatically identify and extract compelling 60-90 second clips from input videos.
- **Virality Optimization:** Utilize AI-driven insights (e.g., engagement scores, hook identification, sentiment analysis) to maximize the viral potential of generated clips.
- **Multimodal Analysis:** Process both audio (transcription, rhythm, sentiment, speaker diarization) and visual (frame analysis, facial expressions, gestures, layout, object tracking) data.
- **Dynamic Editing:** Apply intelligent editing decisions, including cuts, B-roll integration, music synchronization, and animated subtitles.
- **User Guidance:** Allow users to provide prompts to guide clip selection.
- **Resilience:** Implement caching and state management for efficient processing and resume capabilities.
- **Extensibility:** Designed with a modular agent-based architecture to allow for easy integration of new analysis techniques or production steps.
