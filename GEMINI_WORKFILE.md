# Improvement Plan for Ollama-Clip-Anything (Based on AI-Creator Analysis)

This plan outlines the implementation of improvements identified from the analysis of the AI-Creator repository, addressing existing problems and enhancing core functionalities.

## 1. Core Functionality & Features

*   **Implement Agent-Based System:**
    *   Develop a sophisticated agent-based system (similar to AI-Creator's `environment/agents` and `MultiAgent` class) where different agents handle specific video production tasks (e.g., storyboarding, audio processing, video editing, content alignment). This will enable more complex and dynamic video generation.

## 2. LLM Usage

*   **Integrate Multi-modal LLMs:**
    *   Explore and integrate multi-modal LLMs (e.g., MiniCPM, ImageBind) to improve segment selection, enable dynamic editing based on content understanding, and generate more creative video narratives.
    *   Adopt a structured approach for managing LLM API keys and base URLs (similar to `environment/config/llm.py` and `config.yml` in AI-Creator).
*   **Develop Specialized LLM Agents:**
    *   Create specialized LLM agents for tasks such as:
        *   **Script Generation:** For dynamic cuts and scene changes.
        *   **Content Summarization:** For news or long-form content.
        *   **Style Transfer:** To adapt content to different tones (e.g., comedic, dramatic).

## 3. Audio Processing

*   **Enhance `audio_processing.py`:**
    *   Implement **Voice Separation** to isolate speech from background noise or music.
    *   Add **Loudness Normalization** for consistent audio levels across clips.
    *   Integrate **Word-level Transcription & Alignment** for precise subtitle generation and to prevent mid-sentence/mid-word cuts.
*   **Investigate Voice Cloning/Generation:**
    *   Explore integrating voice cloning technologies (e.g., CosyVoice, fish-speech, seed-vc) to offer diverse voice options for subtitles or narration and adapt voices for different content styles.

## 4. Video Processing & Editing

*   **Dynamic Editing & Rhythm Sync:**
    *   Implement rhythm detection and analysis in `video_editing.py` to enable cuts and transitions synchronized with music beats or speech patterns.
*   **Improve Visual Retrieval & Tracking:**
    *   Enhance `face_tracking.py` and `object_tracking.py` by:
        *   Integrating a robust image embedding model (e.g., ImageBind) for better recognition.
        *   Implementing a system to store and retrieve character images (`face_db`) for more accurate tracking and content alignment.
*   **Add Visual Effects (VFX):**
    *   Explore libraries or techniques for adding basic visual effects (text overlays, simple animations, color grading) in `video_effects.py` to make the output visually appealing.

## 5. Personalization & User Input

*   **Enhance Detailed Prompting:**
    *   Improve the user input mechanism to accept more detailed and structured prompts, allowing users to specify desired themes, characters, editing styles, and specific phrases.
    *   Define clear prompt templates or guidelines for users.
*   **Implement Configurable Inputs:**
    *   Create a configuration system (e.g., using YAML files similar to `cross_talk.yml` in AI-Creator) for custom clip themes, vertical/horizontal splits, and other personalization options. This will allow users to define and save their preferred formatting and styles.

## 6. Project Structure & Dependencies

*   **Adopt Modular `tools/` Directory:**
    *   Consider creating a dedicated `tools/` directory for managing external models and libraries (e.g., large AI models) to promote modularity.
*   **Consider Migrating to `pyproject.toml`:**
    *   While `requirements.txt` is currently used, evaluate migrating to `pyproject.toml` for improved project management and dependency resolution in the long run.
*   **Ensure Robust Dependency Management:**
    *   Verify and document clear instructions for model downloads and overall dependency management, especially for large models.

## Note: Some of these are alraedy implemented. Still see if u can improve them or fix them if broken.
