Current work focus: Addressing video processing pipeline failures and optimizing LLM calls.

Recent changes:
- Reverted `core/config.yaml` to use `h264_nvenc` as the video encoder.
- Modified `video/frame_processor.py` to adjust timestamps during frame extraction to prevent out-of-bounds errors, specifically for the last frame.
- Modified `video/clip_enhancer.py` to include `-v debug` flag in FFmpeg commands for more verbose output, to help diagnose the `h264_nvenc` driver issue.
- Modified `agents/hook_identification_agent.py` to parallelize LLM queries for hook analysis using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. The `HookAnalysis` class and `system_prompt_for_hook_analysis` were moved outside the `execute` method for proper scope and to fix the unterminated string literal.
- Fixed `generate_subtitles_efficiently()` call in `agents/video_production_agent.py` by passing the `video_width` argument.
- Implemented LLM batching and model rotation in `agents/hook_identification_agent.py` and `llm/llm_interaction.py` to adhere to `requests_per_minute` limits and switch models proactively.
- Removed the explicit 60-second wait in `agents/hook_identification_agent.py` after a batch completion, now immediately switching to the next LLM model if remaining tasks exist.
- **Enabled `AudioRhythmAgent` in `core/config.yaml` to ensure rhythm data is generated for the `MusicSyncAgent`.**

Next steps:
- The application is still failing the Quality Assurance check in the `VideoProductionAgent`.
- The root cause is that `AudioIntelligenceAgent` and `LayoutSpeakerAgent` are not being executed before `VideoProductionAgent`.
- The next step is to reorder the agent pipeline in `main.py` to ensure the correct execution order.

Active decisions and considerations:
- The `h264_nvenc` encoder is preferred, and the Nvidia driver issue needs to be resolved externally if hardware acceleration is desired. For now, the focus is on getting the pipeline to complete successfully.
- The frame extraction error was due to requesting a timestamp slightly beyond the video's actual duration. The fix in `video/frame_processor.py` should mitigate this by adjusting the timestamp to be within bounds.
- Increased FFmpeg verbosity to gather more diagnostic information about the `h264_nvenc` driver issue.
- Parallelizing LLM calls in `HookIdentificationAgent` should significantly improve performance.
- Encountered API rate limits during the last run, indicating a need to manage LLM calls more efficiently or increase quotas. The new batching and model rotation logic is a direct response to this.
- The `MusicSyncAgent` was failing due to missing rhythm data. Enabling the `AudioRhythmAgent` should resolve this dependency.

Important patterns and preferences:
- Prioritize stability and successful completion of the video processing pipeline.
- Ensure robust error handling for video file operations.
- Optimize performance where possible through parallelization.

Learnings and project insights:
- `replace_in_file` requires exact matches, including comments. `write_to_file` is a reliable fallback for complete file overwrites, especially for larger structural changes or when `replace_in_file` is problematic.
- Video processing can be sensitive to precise timestamp requests, especially at the end of a video.
- FFmpeg's `-v debug` flag can provide crucial diagnostic information for encoding issues.
- Parallelizing independent LLM calls can significantly speed up processing.
- Proper placement of class and variable definitions (outside methods) is crucial for correct Python execution and avoiding issues like unterminated string literals when modifying code.
- A regression or oversight in subtitle generation parameters has been identified, requiring `video_width` to be passed to `generate_subtitles_efficiently`. This has now been addressed.
- API rate limits for LLM calls are a practical constraint that needs to be considered for future runs. The new batching and model rotation logic is a direct response to this.
- Agent dependencies must be carefully managed in the `config.yaml` to ensure all necessary data is available for downstream agents.
