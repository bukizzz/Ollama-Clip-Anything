# Progress: 60-Second Clips Generator

## What Works:
- Core pipeline for generating 60-90 second clips is functional.
- LLM integration for clip selection, summarization, and dynamic editing (zoom events) is working.
- Speaker diarization and audio analysis are integrated.
- Subtitle generation and rendering are in place and working correctly.
- NVENC hardware acceleration is configured and working.
- Robust error handling for LLM interactions and FFmpeg processes.
- State management and caching are implemented for resume functionality.
- Dynamic zoom effects are now controlled by LLM-generated events, with subtle transitions and cooldowns.
- `ffmpeg-normalize` integration is resolved.
- `VideoInputAgent` no longer prompts for input when command-line arguments are provided.
- Audio-video desynchronization after the first scene change has been resolved.
- Dynamic resolution calculation now correctly maintains the source video's height, while adjusting width to match target aspect ratios.
- Subtitle rendering has been fixed to correctly position subtitles based on the output video's width.
- Parallelized LLM calls for hook identification in `agents/hook_identification_agent.py` are implemented.
- **The `generate_subtitles_efficiently()` call in `agents/video_production_agent.py` has been fixed by passing the `video_width` argument.**

## What's Left to Build:
- Implement a more robust mechanism for `LLMSelectionAgent` to adhere to clip duration constraints (60-90 seconds).
- Address the "Quality assurance complete. Status: fail" message (now understood as informational, but still needs to be handled gracefully or removed if unnecessary).
- Address API rate limits for LLM calls.

## Current Status:
- The project has successfully implemented dynamic resolution switching, adhering to the user's requirement for maintaining source video height.
- The A/V desynchronization issue has been successfully resolved through significant refactoring in `video/clip_enhancer.py` to process audio and video together for each scene.
- Subtitles are confirmed to be rendering correctly and are now properly positioned.
- The `HookIdentificationAgent` now uses parallel LLM calls, which should improve performance.
- The pipeline completed with 5 successful clips, but encountered API rate limits.

## Known Issues:
- "Quality assurance complete. Status: fail" message (informational, but needs review).
- CUDA/cuDNN factory registration warnings at startup (non-blocking).
- API rate limits for LLM calls are being hit.

## Evolution of Project Decisions:
- Initial reliance on MoviePy's `write_videofile` proved problematic for NVENC and complex pipelines, leading to a shift towards direct FFmpeg `subprocess` calls.
- Transitioned from real-time engagement-driven zoom to LLM-pre-calculated zoom events for more controlled and less erratic visual effects.
- Implemented robust JSON extraction and LLM model switching to handle API rate limits and malformed responses.
- Moved from separate audio and video processing to a unified, scene-by-scene A/V processing approach to tackle desynchronization, which has now been resolved.
- Implemented dynamic resolution and aspect ratio selection to ensure optimal output for various platforms, with a specific focus on maintaining source video height.
- Removed `FramePreprocessingAgent` from the pipeline. Its functionality for frame extraction is now handled directly by `StoryboardingAgent` (for scene boundaries) and `MultimodalAnalysisAgent` (for rate-based analysis), making the dedicated preprocessing agent redundant.
- Removed Qwen-VL analysis from `MultimodalAnalysisAgent` to reduce excessive API usage. `StoryboardingAgent` will continue to provide LLM-based scene understanding at key moments.
- Implemented concurrent LLM calls for image analysis in `llm/image_analysis.py` using `ThreadPoolExecutor` to improve performance and better utilize LLM rate limits.
- Fixed last frame extraction issue in `StoryboardingAgent` by adjusting the end timestamp for frame extraction to `video_info['duration'] - 0.01` seconds, and adding a fallback to `video_info['duration'] - 0.1` seconds if the initial attempt fails.
- Parallelized LLM calls in `agents/hook_identification_agent.py` to improve performance.
- Identified a missing `video_width` argument in `generate_subtitles_efficiently` within `VideoProductionAgent` as a new issue, which has now been resolved.
- Noted API rate limit encounters as a recurring issue.
